<h3 id="1-personal-background">1. Personal Background</h3>
<p>During my youth, growing up in the province of Utrecht (NL), 
I navigated my way through elementary and high-school, whilst playing
a multitude of sports on the side. Starting off at the football pitch,
I switched to road cycling and later to athletics, also participating in
some duathlon&rsquo;s and a triathlon on the side.</p>
<p>In high-school I developed a liking for both foreign languages (French,
German, English as well as Greek and Latin) and maths.
This lead me to opt for Economics as my major for my final years, 
as it both gave me some elements of match and the opportunity to follow
many language courses - together with the outlook of being able to
study or work abroad one day.</p>
<p>Already before the start of my Bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Utrecht, I applied
for a programme that would allow me to study in Rome (IT) for a full year. 
Being accepted, this was a dream come through: not only did I appreciate
the history and culture of the eternal city, but it also gave me the chance
to learn Italian.</p>
<p>Upon finishing my Bachelor&rsquo;s back in the Netherlands, I decided that I would
want another experience abroad during my Master&rsquo;s degree.
Many Master&rsquo;s degrees being completely taught in English, it occured to me that
I did not necessarily have to stick to the Netherlands as my home base.
After weighing my options, I finally decided to move to Switzerland for a Master&rsquo;s
in Business Analytics at the HEC Lausanne. For me, this felt like a place where
I would be challenged academically, socially - as I didn&rsquo;t know anyone yet, and 
sportively - being able to go running and cycling up the hills and mountains surrounding
the city.</p>
<p>After having spent almost two years in Lausanne, making new friends, going for 
plenty bike rides and fine-tuning my French, it was time to think about where I
wanted to start my career - first of all through the choice of my internship.
This lead me to ultimately end up in Zurich: a place that offered me the possibility
to keep up my German, French and Italian language skills, to go for numerous
new bike rides around the lake and to start working in an international and
challenging environment.</p>
<h3 id="2-professional-interests">2. Professional Interests</h3>
<p>My professional interests where mostly formed over the course of my Master&rsquo;s.
Studying a mixture of programming, statistics and management, I started to get
a liking for all three of them. Being the least familiar with the former subject,
I tried to take courses that would boost my technical skills in coding, machine learning,
optimization and econometrics. Having previously studied economics, however, I
couldn&rsquo;t help still being interested in the financial and organisational sides of the 
equation. As excited as I was about my newly acquired knowledge, I realized they
would be the best help to me in a situation where I could turn insights generated
by these approaches into real, noticable value.</p>
<p>In my current position, I am working as a bridge between the data and commericial or
financial decision makers. By creating more transparancy regarding internal processes,
internal stakeholders are quicker to notice areas of improvement. By making existing
analyses more granular, there is an opportunity to look at developments at local regions
rather than at a country level. By providing statistical analyses into i.a. product launches 
and retention policies, future strategy can be steered into a more profitable direction
for the company. At the same time, I started to recognize the importance of &ldquo;soft skills&rdquo;
within an organisation: being able to communicate in a clear and concise manner, 
sticking to the right level of detail and tailoring the message to the audience at hand.</p>
<p>At 23 years of age, I am not done learning yet and am very much looking forward to
what the future has in store!</p>
